	* what is a makerspace?
	* history

## Introductions

* name
* background
* what (if anything) do you know of 3d printing?
* why are you interested in 3d printing?

# Topics

## What is 3d printing?

* techniques
    * additive manufacturing
	* sintering
	* stereolithography
	* fused filament
* compare to trad. manufacturing
    * rapid prototyping
	* advantages of custom manufacturing
	* producing things on demand
		* no need to stockpile parts
	* environmental friendliness (shipping, waste etc)
* results
	* look at completed models

## Printers

* open source
	* open source vs closed source
		* free beer vs free speech
	* history of open source software
		* shareware
		* linux
* open source printers vs closed source
	* history of 3d printers
		* reprap
		* now lots of companies, printers, price ranges
		* successful open source printer companies
			* introduce TAZ5, talk about Lulz
* mechanics
	* heated bed etc
	* XYZ axes
	* adhesion
		* importance
  		* what affects adhesion?
			* speed
			* temperature
				* extrusion
    			* bed
   			* bed gap
   				* bed levelling (demonstrate)

## GCode

* gcode - codes to tell the print head what to do
* examples on screen
	* what the different letters/numbers do
	* big list of gcode commands (control the whole machine)
	* simple one-person examples
		* move head
		* extrude plastic
		* set temperature
		* move + extrude
		* simple shapes (one per person)
			* square
			* circle
			* triangle
			* etc
 
## Slicing
 
* thingiverse
	* talk about thingiverse
	* open source modelling
	* customisation example
	* paid alternatives ie shapeways
* test cube
	* import test cube
	* slice test cube
	* learn about parameters that affect print quality
		* speed
		* filament diameter
		* layer height
		* etc ...
* simplify3d troubleshooting guide
	* https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/
	* bookmark on user laptops
	* discuss which parameters affect which problems
* students slice on laptops
	* show how changing parameters changes gcode properties
		* external layers
		* layer height
		* infill
		* supports
		* etc
* instructor slices on big screen
	* gcode
		* look at gcode produced
			* lots of lines
			* show individual square
			* show z change
		* use gcode to print test cube
			* sd-card
			* one for whole class

## Modelling

* software on student laptops
* simple modelling exercise
	* model test cube (like the one that they just downloaded/printed)
* more complex modelling exercise
	* house (or similar)
		* square + triangles
		* cut holes for windows/doors
* customised modelling exercise
	* name plate
	* print to take home

## Bonus Tasks

* Start 2-colour print at beginning
* Topics
	* 2 colour printing
	* OpenSCAD
* Further printing
	* Print bonus model from thingiverse
	* Collect at next SparkCC meetup
	* Everyone gets a sparkcc free visit token
		* 3d print these!!!
